                    <h1>Hinglaj Mata Yatra</h1>
                    <p>The Hinglaj Mata Yatra is one of the most significant religious pilgrimages in Pakistan and South
                        Asia. It takes place annually at the Hinglaj Mata Temple, located within Hingol National Park in
                        Balochistan. The temple is an important spiritual site for Hindu devotees and is considered one
                        of the 51 Shakti Peethas.

                        The pilgrimage is usually held during the spring months (March–April) and attracts thousands of
                        pilgrims from across Pakistan and neighboring countries. Devotees travel long distances through
                        the rugged landscapes of Hingol National Park to reach the sacred shrine, making the journey
                        both a spiritual and cultural experience.</p>

                        7th to 9th July at the Shandur Pass, known as the world’s highest polo ground. Traditional

                        by folk music, dancing, and campsite activities that celebrate mountain culture and community

                    <h1>Kalash Spring Festival</h1>
                    <p>The Kalash Spring Festival, locally known as Chilam Joshi, is a traditional cultural festival
                        celebrated annually by the Kalash community in the Kalash Valleys of Chitral, located near
                        several protected and mountainous regions of northern Pakistan. The festival is usually held in
                        May and marks the arrival of spring, symbolizing renewal, fertility, and gratitude for nature’s
                        blessings.

                        During the festival, community members wear traditional embroidered dresses and participate in
                        folk music, dancing, and ceremonial gatherings. Rituals are performed to welcome the new season,
                        seek prosperity, and strengthen community bonds.</p>

                    <h1>Silk Route Festival</h1>
                    <p>The Silk Route Festival is an annual cultural festival celebrated in Gilgit-Baltistan, a region
                        closely connected to Central Karakoram National Park and other protected mountain landscapes.
                        The festival is inspired by the ancient Silk Route, a historic trade network that once connected
                        South Asia, Central Asia, China, and Europe. This route played a major role in cultural
                        exchange, trade, and the spread of traditions across the region.

                        The festival is usually held during the summer months, when weather conditions allow visitors to
                        travel easily through the mountainous terrain. It aims to promote cultural heritage, tourism,
                        and regional identity while highlighting the natural beauty of northern Pakistan.</p>
